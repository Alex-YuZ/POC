# Anagrams

An **anagram** is a type of word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once. That is to say, **all words in an anagram family have the same collection of letters**. For example, the words *`stone`, `notes`, `onset`, `tones`* constitute an anagram.  

This program allows you to input any word you'd like to output those words which share the same anagrams.
